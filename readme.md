# Surface Screen Fix

## An extension for Gnome-Shell

This extension will create a white line on the top of the screen.

There is a hardware issue frequently occuring with Microsoft Surface devices,
where vertical lines (in the color that is not present in that specific column your screen!) appear
after some time using the device. (black screen -> white lines, blue screen -> orange lines)

By adding a white (red green and blue) pixel to every column, no / very few lines will appear.
